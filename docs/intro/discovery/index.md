!!! danger "DRAFT"

    This page is a work in progress and is subject to change at any moment.

It involves the identification of active compounds for the specific target.
These compounds serve as a lead molecule for the generation
of more active compounds.

-   Brief explanation of the Discovery phase in CADD, highlighting its role in the early stages of drug development.
-   Importance of leveraging computational tools to streamline the identification of viable drug candidates.

## Target Identification

Key Steps in Target Identification

Research and Discovery: Initial research to identify proteins, enzymes, receptors, or genes associated with a disease.
Validation: Ensuring the biological target's role in disease progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

Methods for Identifying Targets

Genetic Associations: Using genetic studies to link genes to diseases.
Biochemical Pathways: Understanding disease mechanisms and identifying key players.
Technological Tools: Leveraging bioinformatics, proteomics, and genomics to discover and validate targets.

Challenges and Considerations

The complexity of diseases and the challenge of identifying a single target.
The need for specificity to minimize side effects and enhance efficacy.

## Lead identification

Sources of Lead Compounds

    Natural sources: plants, microorganisms, marine organisms.
    Synthetic compounds: libraries of chemically diverse molecules.
    Biotechnological approaches: phage display, synthetic biology.
    Repurposing existing drugs: finding new uses for approved or investigational drugs.

High-Throughput Screening (HTS)

    Introduction to HTS: rapid testing of thousands to millions of compounds.
    Description of the HTS process: preparation, screening, and hit identification.
    Types of assays used in HTS (e.g., biochemical, cell-based).

In Silico Screening and Computational Methods

    Overview of computer-aided drug design (CADD).
    Structure-based drug design (SBDD) and ligand-based drug design (LBDD).
    Virtual screening techniques and molecular docking.
    Importance of in silico methods in reducing time and cost.

Discuss the balance between specificity and broad applicability in high-throughput screening to avoid missing potential leads.

## Lead optimization

Introduction to Lead Optimization

    Briefly define lead optimization and its critical role in refining drug candidates for enhanced efficacy, selectivity, and safety.
    Mention the transition from identifying potential leads to optimizing these compounds for clinical development.

Initial Evaluation of Hits

    Overview of the initial assessment focusing on potency, specificity, and preliminary pharmacokinetic properties to ensure candidates have a viable starting point for optimization.

Strategies for Lead Optimization

    Introduce the concept of Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) studies and chemical modification as foundational strategies to improve drug properties.
    Mention the goal of these strategies: to enhance drug-like characteristics, such as increased activity against the target, reduced off-target effects, and improved stability.

Role of ADMET Studies

    Highlight the importance of evaluating Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) early in the optimization process to predict how the drug behaves in the body.
    Briefly describe the objective of ADMET studies: to ensure the lead compounds have acceptable safety profiles and efficacious therapeutic windows.

Expand on how iterative cycles of testing and modification play into the optimization process, including the role of feedback loops from biological testing to computational modeling.
