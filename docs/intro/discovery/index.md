# 1.2 Discovery

Drug discovery is a critical stage in the drug development pipeline, laying the foundation for creating safe and effective medicines.
This phase involves identifying potential drug candidates that can interact with specific biological targets associated with a disease or condition.
The drug discovery process has evolved significantly over the years, with the integration of computational methods playing a crucial role in streamlining and accelerating the identification of promising lead compounds.

## Definition and importance

Drug discovery identifies and validates new drug candidates to potentially treat or prevent a specific disease or condition.
This phase is the first step in the drug development pipeline and is followed by preclinical studies, clinical trials, and regulatory approval.
The success of the entire drug development process heavily relies on the efficiency and effectiveness of the drug discovery phase.

The main objectives of drug discovery are to:

-   Identify and validate biological targets associated with a disease or condition
-   Discover compounds that can interact with these targets to produce the desired therapeutic effect
-   Optimize the properties of these compounds to enhance their efficacy, safety, and drug-like characteristics

## Role of computer-aided drug design

Computer-aided drug design (CADD) has revolutionized drug discovery by leveraging computational methods to identify and optimize potential drug candidates.
CADD techniques can be broadly categorized into structure-based drug design (SBDD) and ligand-based drug design (LBDD), depending on the availability of structural information about the target or known ligands.

The main advantages of CADD in drug discovery include:

-   CADD can rapidly screen vast libraries of compounds and prioritize the most promising candidates for experimental validation, reducing the time and cost associated with traditional screening methods.
-   Computational methods can provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying drug-target interactions, guiding the optimization of lead compounds.
-   CADD enables the rational design of compounds with desired properties, such as enhanced potency, selectivity, and drug-like characteristics.

## Overview

The drug discovery phase can be divided into three main stages: target identification, lead identification, and lead optimization.

-   **Target identification**
    This stage involves identifying and validating biological targets (e.g., proteins, enzymes, receptors, or genes) that play a critical role in the disease or condition of interest.
    Computational methods, such as bioinformatics and systems biology, can aid in the identification and prioritization of potential targets.
-   **Lead identification**
    Once a target has been identified, the next stage is to discover compounds that can interact with the target to produce the desired therapeutic effect.
    This stage involves screening large libraries of compounds using high-throughput screening (HTS) or virtual screening methods to identify hits that show promising activity against the target.
-   **Lead optimization**
    The lead optimization stage focuses on improving the properties of the identified hits to enhance their efficacy, selectivity, and drug-like characteristics.
    This stage involves iterative cycles of chemical modification, biological testing, and computational modeling to guide the optimization process.
    The ultimate goal is to select one or more optimized lead compounds that can progress to preclinical studies.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into each stage, exploring the computational methods and strategies employed in modern drug discovery.
