# 2.2.1 Thermodynamics

Protein-ligand binding is a fundamental process that underlies virtually all biological processes, from enzyme catalysis and signal transduction to the action of drugs.
A deep understanding of the thermodynamics that govern the recognition and association of proteins with their ligands is therefore critical for fields such as biochemistry, cell biology, and especially drug discovery.
In this chapter, we will delve into the energetic basis of molecular recognition, exploring the kinetics and thermodynamic forces that drive binding equilibria.
We will learn how to quantify binding through parameters like the dissociation constant ($K_d$) and binding free energy ($\Delta G$), and see how these relate to kinetic constants like on- and off-rates.
