# Structure-based drug design

Structure-based drug design (SBDD) marks a paradigm shift in the world of pharmaceutical development.
It moves away from the slow and resource-intensive process of randomly testing vast libraries of molecules.
Instead, SBDD leverages the power of computational modeling and detailed knowledge of disease targets.
By using the 3D structure of these targets, researchers can virtually design drugs that specifically interact with the disease-causing mechanisms at the molecular level.
This targeted approach offers a much faster and more efficient drug discovery process than traditional methods, with the potential for significantly higher success rates.
It's akin to having a detailed map guiding you to a successful drug rather than stumbling around in the dark.

??? note "Context"

    **Why are we here?**

    Drug discovery is a complex and often time-consuming process.
    Traditionally, it involved trial-and-error methods of testing countless molecules to find ones with the desired therapeutic effect.
    However, the advent of computer-aided drug design (CADD) techniques has revolutionized this field.

    **Where are we now?**

    By using the 3D structure of disease-causing molecules, SBDD allows researchers to virtually design drugs that specifically interact and disrupt these mechanisms at the molecular level.
    This targeted approach offers a much faster, more efficient, and potentially more successful drug discovery route than traditional methods.
