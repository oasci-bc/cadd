# CADD - Breadcrumbs

TODO:

## What is Breadcrumbs?

Education stands as a pivotal force in socioeconomic mobility.
Yet, generational barriers outside of an individual's influence hinder a person's access to educational opportunities.
Breadcrumbs represents [OASCI's](https://www.oasci.org/) initiative to fundamentally transform access to educational materials, embodying the spirit of discovery and the sharing of knowledge fragments that have traditionally been accessible only through the goodwill of others.
Breadcrumb websites are freely accessible resources, and we encourage contributions, improvements, and adaptations so long as they abide by the terms outlined in the [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license.

## Deploying

We use [bump-my-version](https://github.com/callowayproject/bump-my-version) to release a new version.
This will create a git tag that is used by [poetry-dynamic-version](https://github.com/mtkennerly/poetry-dynamic-versioning) to generate version strings.

However, we are using [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/) which means we need to manually specify new versions.
For example, to bump the version to November 8, 2024, you would run the following command after activating the relevant conda environment.

```bash
bump-my-version bump --new-version 2024.11.8
```

After releasing a new version, you need to push and include all tags.

```bash
git push --follow-tags
```

## Web analytics

Why would we want to track website traffic?

An instructor can gain insights into how students engage with online teaching materials by analyzing web analytics.
This information is instrumental in assessing the effectiveness of the materials.
Web analytics reveal the popularity of specific topics or sections among students and empower instructors to tailor future lectures or discussions.
Analytics also provides valuable data for curriculum development, helping instructors identify trends, strengths, and weaknesses in course materials.
Additionally, instructors may leverage web analytics as evidence of their commitment to continuous improvement in teaching methods, which is helpful in discussions related to professional development, promotions, or tenure.

We track website traffic using [plausible][plausible], which is privacy-friendly, uses no cookies, and is compliant with [GDPR][gdpr], [CCPA][ccpa], and [PECR][pecr].
We also share [this website's analytics with you][plausible-link] for additional transparency.
